### Course 1: Networks Overview 

- NIC: Network interface Card 

- Resources can be a server, a document, a webpage etc...

- At the most basic level data is sent in frames/packets in binary.  Frames are created/destroyed w/in in NIC and they have a max of 1500 bits 

- A hub acts as a repeater in that it sends the same singal out on all ports 

- A MAC address (as seen in ipconfig, but to see the MAC you need ipconfig /all) is 48 bits, and the first 3 bits are the manufacturer, but the last 4 bits are the Unique ID.  The frame has the sending MAC address and the receiving MAC address, the data, and the CRC.  

- Broadcast vs Unicast:

    - Broadcast:  (always all F's) Frame sent to every computer on the network device 

    - Unicast: Frame sent to specific device/destination.

    - Broadcast domain: every device connected to a device that propogates network data/frames


- Various network devices: 

    - Hub: repeater, any incoming data is sent to every other device on the network 

    - Switch: Keeps a MAC table with devices on the network and sends to the appropriate device 

- MAC address don't ID that everything is on a specific LAN

- Logical addressing is predominately as an IP address, which will specify the domain.

- Routers are used to connect domains, which have at least 2 connections

- Packets reside w/in frames and consist of the source IP, destination IP, and data

- Routers have a routing table of networks that it's aware of 

- Port numbers are unique to applications (e.g. port 80 = web server/page ), there are source/destination ports and the first 1024 are "well known ports" with a theoretical maximum of 65,532

- port 80 = HTTP, 20/21 = FTP,

- TCP = Transmission Control Protocol  has a sequencing number, and an ACK which makes sure that everything gets to the destination correctly and verifies that the recieving device is connected 

- UDP = User Datagram Protocol, not connection/verification oriented

- OSI model (Open System Interconnect)

    - 1 Physical layer: cables 
    - 2 Data link: MAC/NICS/Switches 
    - Network: Logical addresses, routers/IP Addresses 
    - Transport: Data is assembled/disassembled here 
    - Session: Actually establishes connection between devices 
    - Presentation: Converts data into correct format 
    - Application: Logic to utilize the data correctly

    

- TCP/IP model

    - 1 Network Interface
    - 2 Internet Link: IP addresses/routers 
    - 3 Transport: Assembly/disassembly, TCP/IP is covered here 
    - 4 Application: Encompases everything that was in Session, Application, Presentation

### Section 2: The Physical Network

- Cox has conductor, insulator, and conductor.  Cable is RG8 (RG for rating grade), cox is rated by impedence/OHMS.  

- BNC connectors end w/ terminators

- *RG6 is used for cable modes and uses an F type connector

- UTP is used the most often in networking today

    - Cat3 uses 16MHz/Mb/s, Cat5 and Cat5e uses 100Mb/s, Cat6 10Gb/s.

    - The connectors usually use either RJ11 or the RJ45(8p8c) connectors

- STP is used where networks that have noise

- Twisted pair has 3 fire ratings including PVC (nothing), riser (basic for offices), plenum (most often used in offices)

    * Know CAT/speed levels

- For fiber optics it has a core, cladding, and then a jacket.  There is multimode and single mode.  Multimode propogates light via LED, single mode cable uses lasers for longer distances.

- Fiber optic usually uses dual mode connectors

- ST connectors are early connectors for fiber optics (round), SC connectors are square, FC connector screws in and looks like an ST connector.  LC connectors are tiny tabs, MT-RJ looks like a single black connector.  

- Fiber optics uses polishing and can uses PC (standard), UPC (rounded), APC (angled), the angle/rounded ness are more expensive but allow for a better connection/data transfer.
